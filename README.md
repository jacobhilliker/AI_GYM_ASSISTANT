# AI_GYM_ASSISTANT

## AI-Powered Gym Assistant App
Introduction
There has been tremendous development in the field of online education which 
has enabled people to learn from the best sources, anywhere and at a lower cost, 
but the same is not true for sports and physical training. The presence of a coach 
is always required which limits the reach and makes it more expensive.
This project aims to build an AI-powered sports coaching app, which 
would give them real-time feedback on their performance and can predict any 
injuries that might occur due to erroneous practices.

## Problem Statement

The final goal of the project is to develop heuristic models for a wide array of common exercises
to support users' gym workout routines. Through this project, we created heuristic models for the
incline press, bench press, shoulder press, and for walking on the treadmill.

# Requirements
```
Mediapipe
Python3.8
Opencv
matplotlib
```

## Future work 
• The feedback given to the user is now in the visual domain. We want to 
achieve the feedback as an audio and haptic feedback.

• To incorporate more exercises to the model and to create an app which can 
identify any given exercise and give real time feedback.

• To be able to predict any future injuries due to wrong posture
